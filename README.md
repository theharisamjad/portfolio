## Prerequisites

You should have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your PC. You should also own a GitHub account.

## Setup

1. Fork this repoistory and clone it to your local machine.

   ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio.git
   ```

2. Edit the [config/config.js](https://github.com/theharisamjad/portfolio/blob/main/config/config.js) file. Replace [config/profile.png](https://github.com/theharisamjad/portfolio/blob/main/config/profile.png) with your image.

   > Note: You need to rename your image file as `profile.png`.

3. Run following scripts in terminal/command prompt to install dependencies.
   ```sh
     npm install
     npm run build
   ```

## Testing

1. To test on your local server, run the following command:

   ```sh
     npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the browser to http://localhost:3000/

## Deployment

If it works locally, you can deploy your project to GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages provides two types of free domains, `<username>.github.io` and `<username>.github.io/<repository>`. You can choose the one that suits your needs. You can learn more about domain types from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).

### Deploy to \<your-username>.github.io/portfolio

Simply you just need to commit and push your changes to github. And [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions#overview) will take care of the deployment. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio`

### Deploy to \<your-username>.github.io

Create a new repository with your username as `<your-username>.github.io`. And let the following command do the job for you.

```sh
  npm run predeploy
  node scripts/pages.js <your-username> master
```

Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io`
